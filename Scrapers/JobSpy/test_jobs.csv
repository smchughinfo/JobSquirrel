We’re building high\\-performance infrastructure to serve OpenAI’s frontier models at massive scale. As part of the inference team, you’ll be responsible for unlocking every last FLOP from our GPUs by designing kernels, tuning memory layouts, and optimizing model execution at the lowest levels of the stack.
  
  

About the Role
  
  

We are looking for a kernel\\-focused engineer to lead efforts in writing, porting, and optimizing GPU kernels used in inference workloads. This role requires deep familiarity with CUDA or equivalent kernel programming environments, and a strong intuition for performance tuning across modern GPU architectures.
  
  

**In this role, you will:**  

Design, implement, and optimize CUDA kernels for inference\\-critical operations (e.g., fused matmuls, custom activation functions, memory layout transforms).
  
  

Analyze performance bottlenecks and optimize kernel execution for throughput and latency.
  
  

Contribute to and extend internal GPU libraries and runtime tools.
  
  

Work closely with hardware\\-specific profiling tools (e.g., Nsight, nvprof) to guide improvements.
  
  

Collaborate with researchers to port or re\\-architect new model operations for production use.
  
  

**You might thrive in this role if you:**  

Have deep expertise in CUDA, and have written high\\-performance GPU code used in production systems.
  
  

Understand GPU memory hierarchies, warp scheduling, and kernel\\-level tuning.
  
  

Have experience debugging low\\-level perf issues with Nsight, cupti, or ROCm tools.
  
  

Are excited to build optimized compute primitives that scale across fleets of accelerators.
  
  

Enjoy working closely with model researchers to bring new operators to life.
  
  

**Nice to have:**  

Contributions to GPU kernel libraries or frameworks (Triton, cuBLAS, cutlass).
  
  

Experience with mixed precision or tensor core optimization.
  
  

Familiarity with MIG, multi\\-instance GPU configurations, or NUMA\\-aware execution.
