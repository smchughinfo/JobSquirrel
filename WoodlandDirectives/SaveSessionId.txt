Please save this current Claude Code session id to a file called CURRENT_RESUME_DIRECTORY/session-id.txt.

Steps:
1. Create a unique todo with content like "JobSquirrel session marker"
2. Get the session ID using: /mnt/c/Users/seanm/Desktop/JobSquirrel/HelperScripts/get-current-session-id.sh "JobSquirrel session marker"
3. Save the result to CURRENT_RESUME_DIRECTORY/session-id.txt

This ensures 100% accuracy even with multiple Claude windows open.
