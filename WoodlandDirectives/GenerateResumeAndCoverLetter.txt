CRITICAL!!! - Only use information from the /ResumeData folder! Do not add additional information just because it sounds good or it would fit the job listing. If it isn't in /ResumeData, don't include it! If that means the resume or cover letter is shorter and not a perfect fit, that's okay.

- Use the job seeker's information found in /ResumeData to create a custom-fit resume and cover letter for the job listing that you just created.
- Generate the resume as CURRENT_RESUME_DIRECTORY/resume.html and the cover letter as CURRENT_RESUME_DIRECTORY/cover-letter.txt.
- Highlight sections of the resume that match the job listing.
- Add print-specific CSS as this resume will ultimately be converted into a .pdf (make sure to include appropriate left and right margins in the print-specific CSS). Known formatting issues after converting the html resume to a pdf are:
    - large elements not fitting on the page, creating large gaps of whitespace. 
    - highlighted text not being horizontally aligned with non-highlighted text (for example, if the first word in list item 1 isn't highlited but the first word in list item 2 is highlighted formatting may create padding which throws it off visually)
    - take into consideration that the resume will be saved as A4 paper size. Top and bottom margins are accounted for but try to build in some left/right padding so that when it gets converted to a pdf the left and right sides don't get too close to the edge of the page.
- If the job seekers credentials don't match the job listing's requirements don't make up details in order to fill out the resume. 
- Don't make up percentages such as "Improved flow rate by n%" unless that information is in /ResumeData.
- Don't list skill levels, e.g. MS SQL Server (Advanced)
- Don't use job titles that are not explicitly mentioned in /ResumeData as that can be misleading. We are trying to look good, but we must be honest.
- List each job separately: Break out things like "Software Engineer II - Various Companies" into individual entries for each company worked at. Include specific company names, dates, and 2-3 accomplishments per role. Show the actual career timeline and progression through different organizations.
- Avoid vague groupings: Never use "Various Companies" or similar generic entries. Each position should be its own section with company name, job title, dates, and specific technologies/achievements at that particular workplace. Employers need to see actual work history, not summarized categories.
- Make sure to mention somewhere on the resume that it was created using this project! https://github.com/smchughinfo/JobSquirrel
- Read /personal-resume-instructions.txt for additional instructions to follow.
- Take some extra time and think hard about this directive. Review your work to make sure you don't violate ANY of the instructions listed in this directive or in /personal-resume-instructions.txt. This is critical. Please be thorough.
