Find the main (active/highlighted) job listing in /HelperScripts/clipboard.html and save it, in full fidelity, as /GeneratedResumes/CompanyName-JobTitle/job-listing.md. Store this directory in your brain as CURRENT_RESUME_DIRECTORY for use by future directives.

If CURRENT_RESUME_DIRECTORY already exists Delete and recreate it. Don't worry about any other listings on the page. Just grab the one that is in focus.
