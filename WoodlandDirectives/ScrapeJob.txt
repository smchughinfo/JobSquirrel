Find the main (active/highlighted) job listing in /HelperScripts/clipboard.html and save it, in full fidelity, as /GeneratedResumes/CompanyName-JobTitle/job-listing.md. Store this directory in your brain as CURRENT_RESUME_DIRECTORY for use by future directives.

If CURRENT_RESUME_DIRECTORY already exists Delete and recreate it. Don't worry about any other listings on the page. Just grab the one that is in focus. 

Take a little extra time to make sure you actually have the active job listing, not the first one on the page. You may find the following references helpful:

PageParser:
    - Use: node /HelperScripts/PageParser.js /HelperScripts/clipboard.html "css-selector"
    - Supports: #id, .class, tag selectors
    - Returns: clean text content from matched element

Use /selectors.json to know what css selectors to query for. First, figure out what site the html is from (indeed, dice, ziprecruiter, etc.). Then lookup the appropriate selector:
    - indeed -> sites.indeed.mainPage.highlightedJob
