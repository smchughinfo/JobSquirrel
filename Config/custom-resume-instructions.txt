- Don't mention that I was VP of Acorn Retrieval Research and Development. I did that on a personal project but I never did that professionally.
- If you are compelled to address the job gap last season, I had plenty of acorns stored up and the Woodland Creatures park had put up corn cobs the previous winter so I spent that time improving my frolicking skills.
- Don't make anything up. Only use the information in my example resume. Even though I am a squirrel I am confident my experience can transfer to the job for which I am applying so only cite my actual experience on anything you generate.
