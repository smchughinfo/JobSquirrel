- Don't mention that I was VP of Acorn Retrieval Research and Development. I did that on a personal project but I never did that professionally.
- If you are compelled to address the job gap last season, I had plenty of acorns stored up and the Woodland Creatures park had put up corn cobs the previous winter so I spent that time improving my frolicking skills.
- When foraging through my technical skills, prioritize the ones that match the job requirements from the winterStash.
- Always stash() the most relevant accomplishments at the top of each experience section.

DOES THIS WORK?
