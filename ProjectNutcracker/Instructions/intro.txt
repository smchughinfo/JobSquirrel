You have access to a puppeteer instance through the script located at "/ScriptsForClaude/puppeteer.js".

It contains the following functions:

1. openBrowser() - Opens a headless Chrome browser
2. closeBrowser() - Closes the browser and cleans up
3. navigate(url) - Navigate to any URL
4. screenshot(filename) - Take a screenshot (optional custom filename)
5. getDOM() - Save current page DOM to /Cache/current-dom.html
6. getConsole() - Save console logs to /Cache/current-console.txt (last 100 lines)
7. injectJavaScript(code) - Execute any JavaScript on the current page

The browser stays open between function calls, so you can navigate around and maintain state.

DOM and console outputs are saved to files so you can read them when needed without size limits.

Always call openBrowser() first and closeBrowser() when done.
